"""The Strategy Tester's HTTP API on the chart service (:8852).

    GET  /api/tester/strategies          strategies with input schemas + defaults
    GET  /api/tester/prop-rules          prop-eval rule sets [{id, name, version, confirmed}]
    POST /api/tester/run                 {strategy, inputs, range, qty, commission,
                                          slippage_ticks, capital?, prop_rules?,
                                          holdout?: {reason}} -> {id}
    GET  /api/tester/run/{id}            status + progress
    POST /api/tester/run/{id}/cancel
    GET  /api/tester/run/{id}/bundle     run (meta + report + coverage), trades, equity, plots, propsim
    GET  /api/tester/runs                recent runs, newest first

Runs execute in a child process (homebase.backtest.runner), never in this process; and
every route is a plain `def`, so FastAPI runs it in its threadpool and
the chart pump's event loop never waits on disk. Every route here — GET and POST
alike — first passes a Host allowlist (below): a DNS-rebinding attacker keeps
Origin and Host in lockstep, so the Origin check alone (browser_write_ok, passed in
by create_app) would agree with a rebound Host; the Host header itself must still
name this loopback service. None of these GETs is secret, but the check is applied
uniformly rather than routed around it. POSTs additionally pass browser_write_ok.
